Problem Statement
Use Case:
You are expected to build a Mobile application where dealers can book drivers through the application for transporting their goods. Your application is expected to have certain features which are listed down below:
There should be 2 types of user logins and signups:
a. As the Dealer
- For new dealer signup, there should be a signup form which will ask the
following details - Name, Mobile Number, Nature of Material, Weight of Material, Quantity, City and State.
- This user can book the drivers from the list of drivers in his dashboard whose interested routes are the same as the dealer's location (State and City).
For eg: If the dealer’s location is Madhya Pradesh-Indore , all the drivers going from/to Madhya Pradesh-Indore should display in the dealers dashboard
- Dealers can also search Driver from (State and City) to (State and City).
b. As the Driver
- For new drivers to sign up, there should be a sign up form which will ask the following details- Name, Age, Truck Number, Mobile Number, Truck Capacity,
Transporter Name, Driving Experience, 3 Interested routes (From- state and city/To- state and city).
- After login, this user can only see the dealers who have booked for his services.
1. Login via
● Username - password
● Login using OTP through the mail. This means OTP should be sent to mail ID.
2. Dealer Home screen should show the list of drivers going through the same route as the dealer's State and City which means the dealer should be able to see the drivers who have mentioned the same interested routes as the dealer’s State and City.
 
3. Drivers Home screen should show the list of Dealers that have booked them.
Note : If we select a particular state then all the cities of that state should be displayed. For Eg: If we select the state as Karnataka then all the cities of Karnataka shall be displayed. -
Deployment :
1) Upload the code on any version control like Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket
2) Deploy the frontend and backend code on any cloud platform like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Heroku or any other platform.
3) For databases,you can use anything. However, we’ll prefer the use of free tier sandboxes on MongoDB Atlas.
